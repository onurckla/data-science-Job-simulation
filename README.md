This project addresses the process of collecting and reviewing customer feedback for British Airways (BA)
As a data scientist at SussexBudgetProductions, I undertook the task of analyzing the IMDB data provided in the movie metadata.csv file to formulate an actionable plan for the company's future film productions.

Firstly, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IMDB data to understand its structure and identify any patterns or trends. This involved examining key variables such as budget, genre, and ratings distribution.

Next, I formulated hypotheses related to the overall aim of the assignment, which was to ensure the success of future film productions. These hypotheses were designed to test various factors that could potentially influence a film's performance at the box office, such as budget, genre, and audience ratings.

To test these hypotheses, I performed experiments using statistical analysis techniques. For example, I conducted regression analysis to determine the relationship between budget and box office revenue, and I used hypothesis testing to compare the performance of different film genres.

Based on the analyses I conducted, I generated actionable recommendations for the company. These recommendations were aimed at maximizing the likelihood of success for future film productions while minimizing financial risk. For instance, I recommended allocating budgets strategically based on genre and implementing targeted marketing strategies to reach the intended audience effectively.

In summary, I successfully completed the three main components of the project:

Exploratory data analysis of the IMDB data.
Formulation and testing of hypotheses related to the project's aim.
Generation of actionable recommendations based on the analyses conducted.
Overall, I believe that my work has provided valuable insights that will help inform decision-making at SussexBudgetProductions and improve the company's chances of success in the film industry.
